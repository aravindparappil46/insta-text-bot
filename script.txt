Where's my suitcase?

Miss. Young lady!

Excuse me. Girls!

Hey, little fella. Hey!

Excuse me, girls. Girls!

Hey, big fella!

Help me make the beds

in the living room.

Come on down here!

Hey, son!

Big fella.

Hey, little guy! Little guy!

Pete's brother

and his family are here.

Trish is going to Montreal.

Montreal? Oh, her family's there.

- Then we're off.

- When?

- Tomorrow.

- You're not ready, are you?

Uncle Frank won't let me

watch the movie...

...but the big kids can.

Why can't I?

I'm on the phone.

When do you come back?

Not till then?

It's not even rated R.

He's just being a jerk.

Kevin, if Uncle Frank says no...

...then it must be really bad.

No, we put the dog in the kennel...

Hey, get off!

Kevin, out of the room.

Hang up the phone and make me,

why don't you?

This kid.

Did you pick up

a voltage adaptor thing?

No, I didn't have time.

- Then how do I shave in France?

- Grow a goatee.

Dad, nobody'll let me do anything.

I've got something, pick up those

MicroMachines that are all over.

Aunt Leslie almost broke her neck.

He was playing

with the glue gun again.

We talked about that.

Did I burn down the joint?

I don't think so.

I made ornaments out of fish hooks.

- My new fish hooks?

- I can't make them out of old ones...

...with dry worm guts stuck on them.

- Peter.

- Come on, Kevin. Out.

Do you guys have a voltage adaptor?

Here's a voltage adapter!

God, you're getting heavy!

Go pack your suitcase.

Pack my suitcase?

- Where's the shampoo?

- I don't live here.

This many people here and no shampoo.

- Are your folks home?

- They don't live here.

- Tracy, did you order the pizza?

- Buzz did.

Excuse me. Are your parents here?

My parents live in Paris.

- Hi!

- Hi!

- Are your parents home?

- Yeah.

- Do they live here?

- No.

Why should they?

All kids, no parents.

Probably a fancy orphanage.

I don't know how to pack a suitcase.

I've never done it once.

- Tough.

- That's what Megan said.

What did I say?

You told him "Tough."

The dope was whining about a suitcase.

What was I supposed to say?

"Congratulations, you're an idiot"?

- I'm not an idiot!

- Really?

You're helpless! We have to do

everything for you.

- She's right, Kev.

- Excuse me, puke-breath. I'm small.

I don't know how to pack.

- I hope you didn't just pack crap.

- Shut up, Linnie.

You know what I should pack?

Buzz told you, cheek-face.

Toilet paper and water.
